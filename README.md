# vigab.cc - URL Shortener

Based on the original project by [ToTo04](https://github.com/ToTo04) and [PoliNetwork](https://github.com/PoliNetworkOrg).
Now strictly **Vibe Coded** by Gabriele via **Google Antigravity**.

## Features

- 🔗 **URL Shortening**: Create short URLs for any polinetwork.org subdomain
- 📊 **Dashboard**: Web interface to manage all shortened URLs
- 🚀 **RESTful API**: Programmatic access for other services
- 📈 **Click Tracking**: Monitor usage of your shortened URLs
- 🗄️ **PostgreSQL**: Persistent storage with PostgreSQL database
- 🎨 **Vibe Coded**: Entirely vibecoded using Google Antigravity

### Why?

This thing is dead simple, and other services can integrate with it via API to create
a butload of shortened URLs. Very cool, very free, which makes it even cooler.

#### Yeah ok but why Next of all things???

No good reason really, but it works, the REST API is handled with `ts-rest`, UI
with `shadcn/ui`, allowing me to autogenerate both an `openapi.json` file and the
docs for it with `@scalar/api-reference-react`.

If I was to do it again I'd try `Hono` with SSG for the UI.

## Setup
